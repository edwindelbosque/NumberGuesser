# The Number Guesser

This paired project is part of Turing School of Software & Design's Mod 1.
In this project we created a number guesser, like the name suggests, it is a web game where two users set a range of two numbers and the computer generates a secret random number for the users to find out.

The users can input their own respective guesses, and also their names, so they get a more personalized experience while playing.

The users will get hints depending if their guessed number was either above or below the winning number.
The users also need to have their guesses be within the initial set range. If they make an invalid range or guess outside the set range, they will get alerted and their results won't be processed until they are following the rules.

Once one of the players guesses the right number, record cards will appear on the left side as a history. It will include the number of attempts it took to guess the right number in that particular match, and the computer will automatically generate a new secret number within the initial range, unless specified otherwise.

Finally, there are also reset buttons that will wipe out the score history on the left side, empty all forms, and generate a new random number to start the game from scratch.
